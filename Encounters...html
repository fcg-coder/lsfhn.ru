<p> Encounters at the end of the world near the
Catholic Chapel at the Argentina Belgrano II Base
with all the emotional landscapes that follow </p>


Philosophers often appeal to fictional lands in order to
illustrate their concepts. Consider Plato with his
Atlantis (Critius, Timaeus), and El Dorado (e.g., Voltaire),
and Hyperborea (e.g., Nietzsche).

Being a mental experiment or an example akin to a
riddle, stories about these lands have become objects
of scientific speculation almost as soon as they appear.
It is fascinating to look for a land that, according to
many sources, existed, even if one has to look tens of
thousands of kilometers south of Attica and find
Atlantis on white maps of Antarctica.


In the project, Atlantis is returned its mental status
through the search for its coordinates in virtual space.
Putting it in a scene that outwardly resembles
Antarctica makes its exploration challenging, but this
does not frighten the heroes of the project who have
come to these lands: the Philosopher, the Scientist, the
Artist, the Director and you. What are they (you, us?)
looking for in Atlantis, which mimicry the Antarctica?
What does the Philosopher, tired enough of questions
of epistemology and honest enough to answer
unambiguously to the question of values, feel? What
will the Scientist do when he finds his cause for the
origin of life on Earth? Why does the Artist want to tear
herself to pieces and become the incorporeal
corporeality of these lands? Why does the Director so
fervently compare the experience of subglacial
exploration to the experience of entering the temple?
What do you want from this space and these people?
