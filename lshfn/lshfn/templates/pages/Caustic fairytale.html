			<h2><strong> Caustic fairytale </strong></h2>
			<p></p>

			<br>

			Psyche breaks the ban; she looks at her enchanted
			husband at night and recognizes him as Cupid, the
			god of love. She goes through many trials to return
			to her beloved, and everything ends up fine - Psyche
			gains immortality to live with her divine husband.
			This plot is played out in many myths and fairy tales,
			and not always its variations end well - the
			connection between the lovers' worlds after breaking
			the ban on knowledge is often broken, and the
			mysterious spouse returns to their worlds
			inaccessible to humans. Olivia Lang, recalling the
			legend of "Cherry of Zennor,"

			writes of the broken
			prohibition as looking beyond the boundary between
			worlds--Cherry smears ointment on her eyes that
			must not be touched, the ointment burns them,
			Cherry washes her face with water from a spring and
			spots little dancing men in it, among whom her
			master
			(Cherry, of course, is in love with him).


			A
			broken prohibition is often followed by banishment
			(Cherry's story) or disappearance (when the spouse
			burns the frog/snake/swan/elven skin of her werewolf
			lover). These legends are built on the fragile
			boundaries between the worlds of the lovers, whose
			distinction is magically emphasized. Their
			intersection brings one or both spouses closer and
			farther apart, refracts and changes the nature of one
			or both of them. It is on these intersections that
			caustic shimmering worlds are built, in which
			mystery, trust, the magical and otherwise magical
			are no longer distinguished <p></p>
