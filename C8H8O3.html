<p> <strong> <h2> C8H8O3 </h2></strong></p>
the city calls itself New Belonne and takes possession of itself in order to wound the autumnal city so that the world will give it another name*.
the action in vr space takes place in a post-apocalyptic city with two moons, fires that leave no trace, and time relative to its fixers. Smog envelops this city constantly - in those moments when it leaves, you notice that it takes with it the smells of the body you came to this city with, and what you took for architecture/infrastructure are nothing more than sequences of molecules dispersed by smog. 
The recombinant city, as William Gibson calls Delaneyâ€™s Bellona, becomes a map of an elusive, disintegrating body. If it is a map, what is behind the indexicality of the molecules spelled out in its history, into which the smog has decomposed the odors of the city's inhabitants and visitors?
*TO WOUND THE AUTUMNAL city.
So howled out for the world to give him a name.
The in-dark answered with wind. (Dhalgren, Chapter I Prism, Mirror, Lens)
